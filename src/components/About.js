                Hello everyone! I am a computer science undergraduate student at
                the College of Staten Island on a mission to become a
                professional software engineer/developer. Powered by VS Code and
                some coffee, I specialize in developing responsive,
                user-friendly web applications using a variety of different
                programming languages and frameworks as you can see under my
                skills. You absolutely came to the right place if you are
                looking for a computer programmer that is passionate about his
                work and is willing to learn and grow through new experiences
                and opportunities. Do not hesitate to reach out to me about
                anything.
              </p>
              <p className="mb-5">
                Outside of programming, you can find me playing or watching
                basketball, working out, capturing landscape photos with my
                camera, or catching up with some of my peers.
